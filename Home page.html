      the story author or creator tries to deliver a message or a theory to the player through the game's story, whether that story is based on real life
      stories, personal experiences or imaginary stories, we can find these stories so much relatable to our actualy lives.

      delivered in many ways... through Novels, visual comics, Movies, Animated cartoons and more, but the difference in experiencing
      a story through a videogame is that you get to interact with the envirounment of the game, as a result you gain more attachment to the characterts
      the story.
