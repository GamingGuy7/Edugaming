  <h2>Rhythm games</h2>
  <p>Personaly speaking.. i played Rhythm games since around 2011, i've experienced many different types of rhythm games so i came to a realisation that this genres
  is rich with content and has no boundries of how much you could achieve, just like any other normal sport or hobbey which require practical practice to increase your
  abilities and reaction times... rhythm games give a similar concept but while letting you enjoy the music you play. In this video you will a pro player of the arcade game
  "Maimai" the who is playing didn't really memorize every note of that beatmap, he actually practiced the game and knows how to react fast and keep up by pressing every single
  note the beatmap throws at him, i know this for a fact because i'm a player of this game myself and i have been practicing since 2 years.

    <h1>Frame data in Fighting games</h1>
    <p>When an ordinary person tries playing a fighting game... they usually just simply try pressing random buttons and just wish for the best, perhaps this act could be the reason
    why many people of the general public view this type of Fighting games as just a game that teaching violence without value and doesn't really give much value as to teaching the player any
    strategies. yet the fighting games genre is viewed differently by the E-sports players, they study something called
    <a class="suicideLink" href="https://thirdpersonblog.wordpress.com/2012/04/18/universal-fighting-game-guide-how-to-read-frame-data/">Frame data</a> which allows them to acknowledge
    the speed of every move a character in order to know the best option possible in each situation during the match, this could lead to many strategies and things that happen inside the mind
    of a player, to better understand the concept of Frame data check the link.
