  <h2>The Story of Godot</h2>
  <p>Ace Attorney is one of the most known visual novels out there, its entry "Ace attorney Trials & Tribulations" is considered by many of the series fans to be
  the best game in the series, i believe one of the major reasons is the introducing of the character "Godot" who made such a strong and well reserved presence in this game
  creating a long term legacy for AAT&T's story. In this video the youtuber "TheStoryteller" will discuss his observation of Godot's character and role in the game, his mentality,
  personality, the reasons he did what he did and how he is a human just like any other who acknowledges his flaws which were caused by the tragic events throughout his life, and
  of course this video is meant to those who already finished the game.

    <h1>Persona 4 saved my life</h1>
    <p>Have you ever wondered if Videogames stories could actually be that much referrable
    to real life that it could change someone's life to the better? here is an <a class="suicideLink" href="https://afterstorygaming.com/2015/11/06/how-persona-4-golden-saved-my-life/">interesting story</a>
    of a person who had the courage to share about his personal suffering story and how playing through the game "Persona 4 Golden" made him learn
    from the game's themes and lessons, as the game is discussing human's abilities to
    better themselves by accepting their true self including their personal flaws as humans and carry on with life while having faith
    that someday they should find a place where they belong amongst people and society.</p>

  <h1>Persona 5 Review (by Shaikhan)</h1>
  <p>This <a class="Persona5Review" href="Persona 5 Review Assignment.pdf" download>Persona 5 Review</a> was written by me "Shaikhan" as as an assignment for the "Multimedia Technologies" course in my university, the review contains spoilers.
   The interesting part of this review assignemnt is that the lecturer asked the students to include a section about how how the game discusses humanity
  and a way to manipulate the game into an Islamic Dawah, thus i discussed this spesific topic by the end of this review. Enjoy!</p>
